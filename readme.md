Scripts and data associated with the PDG-Arena forest growth model. PDG-Arena is based on ecophysiological processes and tree-tree interactions. It is part of Physio-Demo-Genetics, a model that is maintained on the [Capsis platform](https://capsis.cirad.fr/capsis/help_en/physiodemogenetics).

Here, you will found :
- scripts that serves at inventory generation and simulation analysis;
- simulation inventories related to publications;
- simulation results files and logs related to publications.

## How to use 
- Git clone this repository or download and extract the repository ZIP file
- Open PDG-Arena-extra.Rproj using RStudio
